Hi there, my name is Jamie Ainsworth. 

I'm interested in web development and am teaching myself HTML, CSS and Javascript with the hopes of attaining a front end web developer role within the future.
You can find some of the projects that I have been working on in the repositores on this profile. 

Thanks
